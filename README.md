Markdown previewer created with React and the new Bootstrap 4 flexbox grid.

Project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Here's a [demo on codepen](http://s.codepen.io/tripleko/debug/VaOWBR/GnAnbnvexxJA).

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
